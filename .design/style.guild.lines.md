normalize: in user interface design: to split software workflow across
different screens, so that each screens is focused on a particular 
task, simplifying the user experience and minimizing confusion

denormolize: the  opposite of normalize

frequency-of-use: how often do the users perform a workflow 
complexity: The maximum number of frames that can be reached from any screen


these are the rule of the UX UI design I am following.
low-frequency (of usage)/ high-complexity. you should normalize it,  
high-frequency (of usage)/ high-complexity- normalize,  
low-frequency (of usage)/ low-complexity- might normalize,  
high-frequency (of usage)/ low-complexity.
make clear calls-to-actions, 
provide context on normalize screens,  
help user recover from errors,
tell Users they were successful, and help them keep going
