Here's a concise description of deploying a containerized application using Docker and EKS:

Containeriz e your application by creating a Dockerfile that defines the environment and dependencies.
Build and test your Docker image locally.
Push the Docker image to Amazon ECR or another container registry.
Create an EKS cluster using eksctl or AWS Management Console.
Configure kubectl to interact with your EKS cluster.
Define Kubernetes manifests (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps) for your application.
Apply the manifests to deploy your application to the cluster.

For scaling and networking:

Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for automatic scaling based on metrics.
Use Cluster Autoscaler to dynamically adjust the number of nodes.
Configure Kubernetes Services for internal networking between components.
Set up AWS Load Balancers with Ingress controllers for external access.
Implement Network Policies for security and traffic control between pods.
Use namespaces to organize and isolate applications within the cluster
